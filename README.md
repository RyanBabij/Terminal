# Terminal

Prototype for a computer terminal menu for my games. The Terminal is modelled after the C64, however it does not aim to be a perfect emulation.

I'm planning to make it part of a cyberpunk RPG where you go around hacking random stuff because cyberpunk. However the hacking in this game is gonna be actual legit hacking, as in reading and writing code, exploiting vulns, all that good stuff. The language is going to be very simple however, so that anyone can learn it. The language is called EASI, and it's basically going to be BASIC with some twists. Most of the old limitations will be removed, but I'm aiming for partial backwards-compatibility with C64 BASIC.

However for now I'm just working on getting the emulator working to the point where you can program games and stuff.
